# Environment Setup Instructions

## üó∫Ô∏è **Mapbox Access Token Configuration**

Your Mapbox access token has been added to the configuration, but for better security and flexibility, you should also create a `.env` file.

### **Step 1: Create .env File**

Create a new file called `.env` in the project root directory (`sanctity-ferme-plant-tracker/.env`) with the following content:

```env
# Mapbox Configuration
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoiYWNrMTk5ODMwIiwiYSI6ImNtZXIydW4xcTAyNzcya29uMDk0dWZkcWgifQ.y741WAV4fH0ezaPdEYdQrg

# Other environment variables can be added here
# REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
# REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### **Step 2: Restart Development Server**

After creating the `.env` file, restart your development server:

```bash
npm start
```

### **Step 3: Test the Map**

Navigate to the Map View in your application to see the beautiful Mapbox maps!

## ‚úÖ **Current Status**

- ‚úÖ **Mapbox token**: Configured in `src/config/mapbox.js`
- ‚úÖ **Fallback token**: Your token is set as the default
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Environment file**: Create `.env` for better security

## üîí **Security Note**

The token is currently hardcoded as a fallback, but it's better practice to use environment variables. The `.env` file will override the hardcoded token when present.

## üéâ **Ready to Use!**

Your Mapbox integration is now ready! The maps should work immediately with your access token.
